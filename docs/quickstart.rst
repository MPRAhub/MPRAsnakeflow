Getting started
=====================

1. Create an :code:`experiment.csv` in the format below, including the header. 
   `DNA_R1` or `RNA_R1` is name of the gzipped fastq of the forward read of the DNA or RNA from the defined condition and replicate. 
   `DNA_R2` or `RNA_R2` is the corresponding index read with UMIs (excluding sample barcodes), and 
   `DNA_R3` or `RNA_R3` of the reverse read. 
   
   If you do not have UMIs remove the columns `DNA_R2` and `RNA_R2` or leave them empty.

  .. csv-table:: experiment.csv
    :file: ../resources/sample/experiment.csv
    :widths: 5, 2, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25
    :header-rows: 1

2. If you would like each insert to be colored based on different user-specified categories, such as `positive control`, `negative control`, `shuffled control`, and `putative enhancer`. To assess the overall quality ,you can create a ``label.tsv`` in the format below that maps the name to category as shown here:

  .. code-block:: text

     insert1_name insert1_label
     insert2_name insert2_label

  The insert `names` must exactly match the `names` in the design FASTA file.

3. Run Association if using a design with randomly paired candidate sequences and barcodes

  .. note:: The association is now in-built in MPRAsnakeflow and doesn't require running this step separately.

4. Run Count

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda activate mprasnakeflow
     snakemake --configfile config/config.yaml --use-conda -p --cores 4

  Be sure that the files, :code:`experiment.csv` and more specifically, the :code:`config.yaml` are correct. All fastq files must be in the same folder given by the :code:`data_folder` option. If you do not have UMIs please use the option :code:`--no-umi`. Please specify your barcode length and umi-length with :code:`bc_length` and :code:`umi_length`.

  The count files generated by the count workflow, are named: :code:`<condition>_<replicate>_counts.tsv.gz` and can be found in the :code:`counts/<condition>/<replicate>` folder inside the `project` folder.
